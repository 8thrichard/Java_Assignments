# JavaFX Calculator


This is a simple JavaFX implementation of a basic calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has the ability to calculate square roots, powers, and perform memory operations such as recall, addition, subtraction, and clear.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the program, you must have the following software installed on your system:

* Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
* JavaFX 11 or later

### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone 
   https://github.com/8thrichard/Java_Assignments.git
2. Navigate to the directory JavaFXCalculator inside the cloned repository
3. Compile the program using the command javac --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add- 
   modules=javafx.controls JavaFXCalculator.java
4. Run the program using the command java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add- 
   modules=javafx.controls JavaFXCalculator

### Usage
The calculator has a graphical user interface (GUI) with text fields, buttons, and labels. Simply click the buttons to perform the desired operation. The following buttons are available:

* Numbers: 0-9 and decimal point (.).
* Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
* Miscellaneous operations: ^ (power), √ (square root), C (clear), ← (backspace), MR (memory recall), MC * (memory clear), M+ (memory add), and M- (memory subtract).
