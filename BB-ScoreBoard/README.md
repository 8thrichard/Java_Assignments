The code provided is a Java application that simulates a basketball scoreboard. The application allows the user to enter the names and jersey numbers of the players of two teams, enter and display the game stats such as fouls, free throws, and shots made, and end the game when desired.


This assignment was coded in both Eclipse and Visual Studio.
